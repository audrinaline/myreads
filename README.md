# MyReads Project

## BACKGROUND
MyReads is a visual bookshelf app that allows users to organize and manage books in categories of 'Currently Reading', 'Want To Read', and 'Read'. User can also search for books, add, or remove from their bookshelf.

## HOW TO INSTALL

To get started developing right away:

* Clone the project repo
* On the command line of your terminal, `cd` into the project folder
* Once inside the folder, run `npm install`
* After running `npm install`, run `npm start`
* `http://localhost:3000/` should automatically open in the browser, if not,  go to your broswer (recommend Chrome) and enter the URL port. 
* Have fun!

## IMPORTANT
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
